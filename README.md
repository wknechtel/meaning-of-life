Meaning of Life Finder
======================

A friend of mine posted a meme on FaceBook yesterday:

>A couple of days ago, when my math teacher asked "Any questions?"
>
>I asked "What's the meaning of life?" She simply replied "The meaning of life is math."
>
>Today, we realized that, in the alphabet,
>M is the 13th letter, A is the 1st letter, T is the 20th letter, and H is th 8th letter.
>
>13 + 1 + 20 + 8 = 42

This is, of course, a fun little nod to the late Douglas Adams' masterwork of
comedic science fiction, "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," where the
answer, the ultimate answer, of life, the uniferse, and everything turns out to
be 42.  The problem is that nobody knows what the question actually is.

After I chuckled at the joke, I wondered what other words might equal 42 in the
same manner that "math" does. This is a reasonably simple task for a programmer
to tackle.  20 minutes later, I knew the answers. Today, in a grand gesture of
magnanimity, I'm sharing the answers with you, dear reader.

life_words.txt has the end result of the program.  And it didn't even take
seven and a half million years to run, nor was my computer destroyed to make way
for a bypass.  Though, you must agree, bypasses have got to be built!

My personal favorites from the list:
- bitch
- borg
- deadbeat
- gnat
- rebel
- five (five == 42, this will be delightfully obtuse to explain to people)
